	abstract = {Human–robot interaction has extended its application horizon to simplify how human beings interact with each other through a remotely controlled telepresence robot. The fast growth of communication technologies such as 4G and 5G has elevated the potential to establish stable audio–video-data transmission. However, human–robot physical interactions are still challenging regarding maneuverability, controllability, stability, drive layout, and autonomy. Hence, this paper presents a systematic design and control approach based on the customer’s needs and expectations of telepresence mobile robots for social interactions. A system model and controller design are developed using the Lagrangian method and linear quadratic regulator, respectively, for different scenarios such as flat surface, inclined surface, and yaw (steering). The robot system is capable of traveling uphill (30\$\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$∘) and has a variable height (600–1200 mm). The robot is advantageous in developing countries to fill the skill gaps as well as for sharing knowledge and expertise using a virtual and mobile physical presence.},

	abstract = {Human-robot collaboration combines the extended capabilities of humans and robots to create a more inclusive and human-centered production system in the future. However, human safety is the primary concern for manufacturing industries. Therefore, real-time motion tracking is necessary to identify if the human worker body parts enter the restricted working space solely dedicated to the robot. Tracking these motions using decentralized and different tracking systems requires a generic model controller and consistent motion exchanging formats. In this work, our task is to investigate a concept for a unified real-time motion tracking for human-robot collaboration. In this regard, a low cost and game-based motion tracking system, e.g., HTC Vive, is utilized to capture human motion by mapping into a digital human model in the Unity3D environment. In this context, the human model is described using a biomechanical model that comprises joint segments defined by position and orientation. Concerning robot motion tracking, a unified robot description format is used to describe the kinematic trees. Finally, a concept of assembly operation that involves snap joining is simulated to analyze the performance of the system in real-time capability. The distribution of joint variables in spatial-space and time-space is analyzed. The results suggest that real-time tracking in human-robot collaborative assembly environments can be considered to maximize the safety of the human worker. However, the accuracy and reliability of the system regarding system disturbances need to be justified.},

	abstract = {Tool-path, feed-rate, and depth-of-cut of a tool determine the machining time, tool wear, power consumption, and realization costs. Before the commissioning and production, a preliminary phase of failure-mode identification and effect analysis allows for selecting the optimal machining parameters for cutting, which, in turn, reduces machinery faults, production errors and, ultimately, decreases costs. For this, scalable high-precision path generation algorithms requiring a low amount of computation might be advisable. The present work provides such a simplified scalable computationally low-intensive technique for tool-path generation. From a three dimensional (3D) digital model, the presented algorithm extracts multiple two dimensional (2D) layers. Depending on the required resolution, each layer is converted to a spatial image, and an algebraic analytic closed-form solution provides a geometrical tool path in Cartesian coordinates. The produced tool paths are stacked after processing all object layers. Finally, the generated tool path is translated into a machine code using a G-code generator algorithm. The introduced technique was implemented and simulated using MATLAB® pseudocode with a G-code interpreter and a simulator. The results showed that the proposed technique produced an automated unsupervised reliable tool-path-generator algorithm and reduced tool wear and costs, by allowing the selection of the tool depth-of-cut as an input.},

In addition to geometric manufacturing flexibility, additive manufacturing offers a resource-saving application for rapid prototyping and small series in predevelopment. In this study, the FDM process is utilized to manufacture the tooling to draw a small series of sheet metal parts in combination with the rubber pad forming process. Therefore, a variety of common AM polymer materials (PETG, PLA, and ABS) is compared in compression tests, from which PLA is selected to be applied as sheet metal forming die. For the rubber pad forming process, relevant processing parameters, i.e., press force and rubber cushion hardness, are studied with respect to forming depth. The product batch is examined by optical evaluation using a metrological system. The scans of the tool and sheet metal parts confirm the mechanical integrity of the additively manufactured die from polymer and thus the suitability of this approach for small series in sheet metal drawing processes, e.g., for automotive applications.},

	abstract = {Flexible and varied manual assembly processes in the automotive industry are often based on manual labor. While simulation can be used to improve planning to maximize efficiency while minimizing ergonomic issues for workers, common simulation tools require extensive modeling time. In such simulations, the users are often process engineers who want to easily create complex human motion simulations. This paper presents a concept developed to create complex human motions for interacting with objects in a production environment with little effort. The concept separates between geometric constraints and the semantic meaning of the respective geometry. With a set of data types developed for this purpose based on a unified ontology, a range of geometric and semantic information can be specified for arbitrary objects. In this way, an action-specific motion generator can be used to define the appropriate motion for the interaction with an object depending on the action without defining case-specific constraints. For a first proof, the concept is tested and demonstrated in the assembly of a pedal car and sitting on a chair at a manual workstation. Based on the use case, the effect of effort reduction is shown.},
