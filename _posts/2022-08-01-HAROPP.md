## Introduction

In recent years, smart workplaces that adapt to human activity and motion behavior have been proposed for cognitive production systems. In this respect, methods for identifying the feelings and activities of human workers are being investigated to improve the cognitive capability of smart machines such as robots in shared working spaces. It is believed that, recognizing human activities and being able to predict the possible next sequence of operations may simplify robot programming as well as improve collaboration efficiency.
However, human activity recognition still requires explainable models that are versatile, robust, and interpretative. Hence, human action recognition based on continuous probability density estimates can be considered as the initial steps of the collaborative workplace design. Three scenarios are considered: a standalone, a one-piece flow U-form, and a human-robot hybrid workplace are evaluated and the results are published on [international journal of computer integrated manufacturing (IJCIM)](https://doi.org/10.1080/0951192X.2023.2177742).
