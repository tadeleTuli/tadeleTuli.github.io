Force compliant industrial robots are used to manipulate soft and deformable objects in real-time simulation.
However, such objects, e.g. additively manufactured elastomers, are difficult to manipulate due to unknown deformation behavior when pressure is applied.
In this regard, we applied a hierarchical force and position controller to analyze how the deformation of additively manufactured objects with different cross-sectional cavities take place.
Therefore, this approach can be applied to analyze the effect of force on the stiffness of objects with cavities {% cite tuli_hierarchical_2019 %}.\\
