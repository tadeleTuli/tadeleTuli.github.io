## Introduction

In humanâ€“robot collaboration (HRC), human motion capture can be considered an enabler for switching autonomy between humans and robots to create efficient and safe operations. For this purpose, wearable motion tracking systems such as IMU and lighthouse-based systems have been used to transfer human joint motions into robot controller models. Due to reasons such as global positioning, drift, and occlusion, in some situations, e.g., HRC, both systems have been combined. However, it is still not clear if the motion quality (e.g., smoothness, naturalness, and spatial accuracy) is sufficient when the human operator is in the loop. This article presents a novel approach for measuring human motion quality and accuracy in HRC. The human motion capture has been implemented in a laboratory environment with a repetition of forty-cycle operations. Human motion, specifically of the wrist, is guided by the robot tool center point (TCP), which is predefined for generating circular and square motions. Compared to the robot TCP motion considered baseline, the hand wrist motion deviates up to 3 cm. The approach is valuable for understanding the quality of human motion behaviors and can be scaled up for various applications involving human and robot shared workplaces.

The details of the work is published on the [international journal of Intelligent Service Robotics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11370-022-00432-8).
