Human-robot collaboration combines the extended capabilities of humans and robots to create a more inclusive and human-centered production system in the future.
However, human safety is the primary concern for manufacturing industries.
Therefore, real-time motion tracking is necessary to identify if the human worker body parts enter the restricted working space solely dedicated to the robot.
Tracking these motions using decentralized and different tracking systems requires a generic model controller and consistent motion exchanging formats.
In this work, our task is to investigate a concept for a unified real-time motion tracking for human-robot collaboration.
In this regard, a low cost and game-based motion tracking system, e.g., HTC Vive, is utilized to capture human motion by mapping into a digital human model in the Unity3D environment {% cite tuli_real-time_2019 %}.
