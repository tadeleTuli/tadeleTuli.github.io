In the automotive industry, human motion simulation is desired e.g. for validating manual assembly process plans. 

It is also useful for alleviating human cognitive capability by assisting human workers using augmented/virtual reality applications 

However, some assembly activities e.g., inserting by applying pressure, are not easy for simulating a human motion.

Therefore, methods for human motion generation for simulation have been presented in various researches. But, most of such solutions are limited to either specific application or single environment.

The current work aims to develop a method that applies the concept of an optimized potential field-based path planning for generating a motion model unit (MMU).

## CIRP CMS 54: Human activity identification 

Identifying human activities from real-time human motion simulation is essential for creating efficient and smooth human-robot collaboration (HRC) plans. 
Wearable sensors are employed for transforming actual human motion behaviors into a digital model.
