I am a researcher and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Siegen, in Germany. My research focuses on Human and Robotics in shared workplace, task and interation. In addition, I have collaborated on Additive manufacturing, mainly in product customization and machine path optimization.

Previously, I have received my M.Sc. in Manufacturing Engineering, from Ethiopia in 2012, and my second M.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering- robotics curriculum from Italy. I had taught various courses as well as held a position of associate dean for the [College of Electrical and Mechancial Engineering](http://www.aastu.edu.et/academics/colleges/college-of-electrical-mechanical-engineering/) in Addis Ababa Science and Technology University.
