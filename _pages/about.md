I am a researcher and Ph.D. candidate at University of Siegen, Germany. My research focuses on Human and Robotics in shared workplace, task and interation. In addition, I have collaborated on Additive manufacturing, mainly in product customization and machine path optimization.

Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. in Manufacturing Engineering, from Ethiopia in 2012, and my second M.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering- robotics curriculum from Italy. I had served as Associate dean for college of Electrical and Mechancial Engineering in Addis Ababa Science and Technology University prior to my departure for my Ph.D. study.
