## Shared autonomy in human-robot collaboration
In virtual production planning, simulating human motions
helps to improve process planning and interaction efficiency. However,
simulating multiple humans sharing tasks in a shared workplace requires
understanding how human workers interact and share autonomy. In this
regard, an Inertial Measurement Unit based motion capture is employed
for understanding shifting roles and learning effects.

## Human activity or task identification

Today, increased demands for personalized products are
making human-robot collaborative tasks a focus of research mainly for
improving production cycle time, precision, and accuracy. It is also
required to simplify how human-robot tasks and motions are generated.
A graphical flow control-based programming can be one of such
methods. Refer at {% cite tuli_comparison_2021 %}
